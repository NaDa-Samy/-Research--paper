# -Research--paper
Coronavirus is one of a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness
ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East
Respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome “SARS”,
coronavirus can transmitted from person to person and to understand its
evolution and genetics scientists have sequenced SARS COVID-19 from patients
and make statistics from group of people with different ages and genders so
now we have a huge data to take a genomic sequences to keep up with the
latest updates developments scientists need to frequently download and clean
a new data sets , COVID -19 SEQ consists of different components : a data
analysis (FASTA sequences and generates variant call sets in VCF “variant call
format “also known as processed files : includes a genomic data and ORF
“open reading frames” is the part of reading frame that has the ability to be
translated , the pipeline automatically filters low –quality sequences and
remove duplicate sequences , performs sequence alignment and identifies
,annotates genetic variant , we use a web server to enable the rapid analysis of
sequences without using programming web interface includes an interactive
genome visualizer and tabulated displays of genetic variants and ORF
predictions further we use command-line interface to facilitate data sharing .
